Every Svelte application starts by imperatively creating a root component. On the client this component is mounted to a specific element. On the server, you want to get back a string of HTML instead which you can render. The following functions help you achieve those tasks.

## `mount`

Instantiates a component and mounts it to the given target:

```js
// @errors: 2322
import { mount } from 'svelte';
import App from './App.svelte';

const app = mount(App, {
	target: document.querySelector('#app'),
	props: { some: 'property' }
});
```

You can mount multiple components per page, and you can also mount from within your application, for example when creating a tooltip component and attaching it to the hovered element.

Note that unlike calling `new App(...)` in Svelte 4, things like effects (including `onMount` callbacks, and action functions) will not run during `mount`. If you need to force pending effects to run (in the context of a test, for example) you can do so with `flushSync()`.

## `unmount`

Unmounts a component that was previously created with [`mount`](#mount) or [`hydrate`](#hydrate).

If `options.outro` is `true`, [transitions](transition) will play before the component is removed from the DOM:

```js
import { mount, unmount } from 'svelte';
import App from './App.svelte';

const app = mount(App, { target: document.body });

// later
unmount(app, { outro: true });
```

Returns a `Promise` that resolves after transitions have completed if `options.outro` is true, or immediately otherwise.

## `render`

Only available on the server and when compiling with the `server` option. Takes a component and returns an object with `body` and `head` properties on it, which you can use to populate the HTML when server-rendering your app:

```js
// @errors: 2724 2305 2307
import { render } from 'svelte/server';
import App from './App.svelte';

const result = render(App, {
	props: { some: 'property' }
});
result.body; // HTML for somewhere in this <body> tag
result.head; // HTML for somewhere in this <head> tag
```

## `hydrate`

Like `mount`, but will reuse up any HTML rendered by Svelte's SSR output (from the [`render`](#render) function) inside the target and make it interactive:

```js
// @errors: 2322
import { hydrate } from 'svelte';
import App from './App.svelte';

const app = hydrate(App, {
	target: document.querySelector('#app'),
	props: { some: 'property' }
});
```

As with `mount`, effects will not run during `hydrate` â€” use `flushSync()` immediately afterwards if you need them to.
