In runes mode, [component props](basic-markup#Component-props) are declared with the [`$props`]($props) rune, allowing parent components to pass in data.

In legacy mode, props are marked with the `export` keyword, and can have a default value:

```svelte
<script>
	export let foo;
	export let bar = 'default value';

	// Values that are passed in as props
	// are immediately available
	console.log({ foo });
</script>
```

The default value is used if it would otherwise be `undefined` when the component is created.

> [!NOTE] Unlike in runes mode, if the parent component changes a prop from a defined value to `undefined`, it does not revert to the initial value.

Props without default values are considered _required_, and Svelte will print a warning during development if no value is provided, which you can squelch by specifying `undefined` as the default value:

```js
export let foo +++= undefined;+++
```

## Component exports

An exported `const`, `class` or `function` declaration is _not_ considered a prop â€” instead, it becomes part of the component's API:

```svelte
<!--- file: Greeter.svelte--->
<script>
	export function greet(name) {
		alert(`hello ${name}!`);
	}
</script>
```

```svelte
<!--- file: App.svelte --->
<script>
	import Greeter from './Greeter.svelte';

	let greeter;
</script>

<Greeter bind:this={greeter} />

<button on:click={() => greeter.greet('world')}>
	greet
</button>
```

## Renaming props

The `export` keyword can appear separately from the declaration. This is useful for renaming props, for example in the case of a reserved word:

```svelte
<!--- file: App.svelte --->
<script>
	/** @type {string} */
	let className;

	// creates a `class` property, even
	// though it is a reserved word
	export { className as class };
</script>
```
