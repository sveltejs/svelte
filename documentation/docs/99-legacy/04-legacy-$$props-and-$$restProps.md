title: $props and $restProps
use_cases: "legacy: spread props, rest props, prop forwarding"

In runes mode, getting an object containing all the props that were passed in is easy, using the [`$props`]($props) rune.

In legacy mode, we use `$$props` and `$$restProps`:

- `$$props` contains all the props that were passed in, including ones that are not individually declared with the `export` keyword
- `$$restProps` contains all the props that were passed in _except_ the ones that were individually declared

For example, a `<Button>` component might need to pass along all its props to its own `<button>` element, except the `variant` prop:

```svelte
<script>
	export let variant;
</script>

<button {...$$restProps} class="variant-{variant} {$$props.class ?? ''}">
	click me
</button>

<style>
	.variant-danger {
		background: red;
	}
</style>
```

In Svelte 3/4 using `$$props` and `$$restProps` creates a modest performance penalty, so they should only be used when needed.
