### Public API of a component

Svelte uses the `$props` rune to declare _properties_ or _props_, which means describing the public interface of the component which becomes accessible to consumers of the component.

> [!NOTE] `$props` is one of several runes, which are special hints for Svelte's compiler to make things reactive.

```svelte
<script>
	let { foo, bar, baz } = $props();

	// Values that are passed in as props
	// are immediately available
	console.log({ foo, bar, baz });
</script>
```

You can specify a fallback value for a prop. It will be used if the component's consumer doesn't specify the prop on the component when instantiating the component, or if the passed value is `undefined` at some point.

```svelte
<script>
	let { foo = 'optional default initial value' } = $props();
</script>
```

> [!NOTE] If a prop is explicitly passed as null, the default value will not be used, and null will be assigned instead. However, if the prop is undefined or not provided at all, the default value will be used.

```svelte
<script>
	let { answer = 3 } = $props();
</script>

<p>The answer is {answer}</p>
```

```svelte
<script>
	import Nested from './Nested.svelte';
</script>

<Nested answer={42} /> <!-- answer is set to 42 -->
<Nested answer={null} /> <!-- answer is set to null (default value is not used)-->
<Nested /> <!-- answer is set to default value -->
<Nested answer={undefined}/> <!-- answer is set to default value -->

```

To get all properties, use rest syntax:

```svelte
<script>
	let { a, b, c, ...everythingElse } = $props();
</script>
```

You can use reserved words as prop names.

```svelte
<script>
	// creates a `class` property, even
	// though it is a reserved word
	let { class: className } = $props();
</script>
```

If you're using TypeScript, you can declare the prop types:

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
	interface Props {
		required: string;
		optional?: number;
		[key: string]: unknown;
	}

	let { required, optional, ...everythingElse }: Props = $props();
</script>
```

If you're using JavaScript, you can declare the prop types using JSDoc:

```svelte
<script>
	/** @type {{ x: string }} */
	let { x } = $props();

	// or use @typedef if you want to document the properties:

	/**
	 * @typedef {Object} MyProps
	 * @property {string} y Some documentation
	 */

	/** @type {MyProps} */
	let { y } = $props();
</script>
```

If you export a `const`, `class` or `function`, it is readonly from outside the component.

```svelte
<script>
	export const thisIs = 'readonly';

	export function greet(name) {
		alert(`hello ${name}!`);
	}
</script>
```

Readonly props can be accessed as properties on the element, tied to the component using [`bind:this` syntax](bindings#bind:this).

### Reactive variables

To change component state and trigger a re-render, just assign to a locally declared variable that was declared using the `$state` rune.

Update expressions (`count += 1`) and property assignments (`obj.x = y`) have the same effect.

```svelte
<script>
	let count = $state(0);

	function handleClick() {
		// calling this function will trigger an
		// update if the markup references `count`
		count = count + 1;
	}
</script>
```

Svelte's `<script>` blocks are run only when the component is created, so assignments within a `<script>` block are not automatically run again when a prop updates.

```svelte
<script>
	let { person } = $props();
	// this will only set `name` on component creation
	// it will not update when `person` does
	let { name } = person;
</script>
```

If you'd like to react to changes to a prop, use the `$derived` or `$effect` runes instead.

```svelte
<script>
	let count = $state(0);

	let double = $derived(count * 2);

	$effect(() => {
		if (count > 10) {
			alert('Too high!');
		}
	});
</script>
```

For more information on reactivity, read the documentation around runes.
