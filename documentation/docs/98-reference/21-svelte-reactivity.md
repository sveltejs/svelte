Svelte provides reactive versions of various built-ins like [`Map`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Map), [`Set`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Set) and [`URL`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/URL) that can be used just like their native counterparts, as well as a handful of additional utilities for handling reactivity.
