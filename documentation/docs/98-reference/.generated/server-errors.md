### async_local_storage_unavailable

```
The node API `AsyncLocalStorage` is not available, but is required to use async server rendering.
```

Some platforms require configuration flags to enable this API. Consult your platform's documentation.

### await_invalid

```
Encountered asynchronous work while rendering synchronously.
```

You (or the framework you're using) called [`render(...)`](svelte-server#render) with a component containing an `await` expression. Either `await` the result of `render` or wrap the `await` (or the component containing it) in a [`<svelte:boundary>`](svelte-boundary) with a `pending` snippet.

### html_deprecated

```
The `html` property of server render results has been deprecated. Use `body` instead.
```

### hydratable_clobbering

```
Attempted to set `hydratable` with key `%key%` twice with different values.

%stack%
```

This error occurs when using `hydratable` multiple times with the same key. To avoid this, you can:
- Ensure all invocations with the same key result in the same value
- Update the keys to make both instances unique

```svelte
<script>
  import { hydratable } from 'svelte';

  // which one should "win" and be serialized in the rendered response?
  const one = hydratable('not-unique', () => 1);
  const two = hydratable('not-unique', () => 2);
</script>
```

### hydratable_serialization_failed

```
Failed to serialize `hydratable` data for key `%key%`.

`hydratable` can serialize anything [`uneval` from `devalue`](https://npmjs.com/package/uneval) can, plus Promises.

Cause:
%stack%
```

### invalid_csp

```
`csp.nonce` was set while `csp.hash` was `true`. These options cannot be used simultaneously.
```

### lifecycle_function_unavailable

```
`%name%(...)` is not available on the server
```

Certain methods such as `mount` cannot be invoked while running in a server context. Avoid calling them eagerly, i.e. not during render.

### server_context_required

```
Could not resolve `render` context.
```

Certain functions such as `hydratable` cannot be invoked outside of a `render(...)` call, such as at the top level of a module.
