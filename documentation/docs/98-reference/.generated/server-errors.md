### async_in_sync

```
Encountered asynchronous work while rendering synchronously.
```

You (or the framework you're using) used `render` with an async component. Either use `renderAsync` or wrap the async component in a `svelte:boundary` with a `pending` snippet.

### lifecycle_function_unavailable

```
`%name%(...)` is not available on the server
```

Certain methods such as `mount` cannot be invoked while running in a server context. Avoid calling them eagerly, i.e. not during render.
