### await_invalid

```
Encountered asynchronous work while rendering synchronously.
```

You (or the framework you're using) called [`render(...)`](svelte-server#render) with a component containing an `await` expression. Either `await` the result of `render` or wrap the `await` (or the component containing it) in a [`<svelte:boundary>`](svelte-boundary) with a `pending` snippet.

### fn_unavailable_on_server

```
`%name%`(...) is unavailable on the server.
```

### html_deprecated

```
The `html` property of server render results has been deprecated. Use `body` instead.
```

### hydratable_clobbering

```
Attempted to set hydratable with key `%key%` twice. This behavior is undefined.

First set occurred at:
%stack%
```

This error occurs when using `hydratable` or `hydratable.set` multiple times with the same key. To avoid this, you can combine `hydratable` with `cache`, or check whether the value has already been set with `hydratable.has`.

```svelte
<script>
  import { hydratable } from 'svelte';
  await Promise.all([
    // which one should "win" and be serialized in the rendered response?
    hydratable('hello', () => 'world'),
    hydratable('hello', () => 'dad')
  ])
</script>
```

### lifecycle_function_unavailable

```
`%name%(...)` is not available on the server
```

Certain methods such as `mount` cannot be invoked while running in a server context. Avoid calling them eagerly, i.e. not during render.

### render_context_unavailable

```
Failed to retrieve `render` context. %addendum%
If `AsyncLocalStorage` is available, you're likely calling a function that needs access to the `render` context (`hydratable`, `cache`, or something that depends on these) from outside of `render`. If `AsyncLocalStorage` is not available, these functions must also be called synchronously from within `render` -- i.e. not after any `await`s.
```
