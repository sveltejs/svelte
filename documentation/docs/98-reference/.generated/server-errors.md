### await_invalid

```
Encountered asynchronous work while rendering synchronously.
```

You (or the framework you're using) called [`render(...)`](svelte-server#render) with a component containing an `await` expression. Either use `renderAsync(...)` or wrap the `await` (or the component containing it) in a [`<svelte:boundary>`](svelte-boundary) with a `pending` snippet.

### experimental_async_ssr

```
Attempted to use `renderAsync` without `experimental.async` enabled
```

Set `experimental.async: true` in your compiler options (usually in `svelte.config.js`) to use async server rendering.

### lifecycle_function_unavailable

```
`%name%(...)` is not available on the server
```

Certain methods such as `mount` cannot be invoked while running in a server context. Avoid calling them eagerly, i.e. not during render.
