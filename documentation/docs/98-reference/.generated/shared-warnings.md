### dynamic_void_element_content

```
`<svelte:element this="%tag%">` is a void element — it cannot have content
```

Elements such as `<input>` cannot have content, any children passed to these elements will be ignored.

### state_snapshot_uncloneable

```
Value cannot be cloned with `$state.snapshot` — the original value was returned
```

```
The following properties cannot be cloned with `$state.snapshot` — the return value contains the originals:

%properties%
```

`$state.snapshot` tries to clone the given value in order to return a reference that no longer changes. Certain objects may not be cloneable, in which case the original value is returned. In the following example, `property` is cloned, but `window` is not, because DOM elements are uncloneable:

```js
const object = $state({ property: 'this is cloneable', window })
const snapshot = $state.snapshot(object);
```
