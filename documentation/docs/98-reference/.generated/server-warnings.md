### unresolved_hydratable

```
A `hydratable` value with key `%key%` was created, but at least part of it was not used during the render.

The `hydratable` was initialized in:
%stack%
```

The most likely cause of this is creating a `hydratable` in the `script` block of your component and then `await`ing
the result inside a `svelte:boundary` with a `pending` snippet:

```svelte
<script>
  import { hydratable } from 'svelte';
	import { getUser } from '$lib/get-user.js';

	const user = hydratable('user', getUser);
</script>

<svelte:boundary>
	<h1>{(await user).name}</h1>

	{#snippet pending()}
		<div>Loading...</div>
	{/snippet}
</svelte:boundary>
```

Consider inlining the `hydratable` call inside the boundary so that it's not called on the server.

Note that this can also happen when a `hydratable` contains multiple promises and some but not all of them have been used.
