title: $state
---

The `$state` rune allows you to create _reactive state_, which means that your UI _reacts_ when it changes.

```svelte
<script>
	let count = $state(0);
</script>

<button onclick={() => count++}>
	clicks: {count}
</button>
```

Unlike other frameworks you may have encountered, there is no API for interacting with state — `count` is just a number, rather than an object or a function, and you can update it like you would update any other variable.

### Deep state

If `$state` is used with an array or a simple object, the result is a deeply reactive _state proxy_. [Proxies](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Proxy) allow Svelte to run code when you read or write properties, including via methods like `array.push(...)`, triggering granular updates.

State is proxified recursively until Svelte finds something other than an array or simple object. In a case like this...

```js
let todos = $state([
	{
		done: false,
		text: 'add more todos'
	}
]);
```

...modifying an individual todo's property will trigger updates to anything in your UI that depends on that specific property:

```js
// @filename: ambient.d.ts
declare global {
	const todos: Array<{ done: boolean, text: string }>
}

// @filename: index.js
// ---cut---
todos[0].done = !todos[0].done;
```

If you push a new object to the array, it will also be proxified:

```js
// @filename: ambient.d.ts
declare global {
	const todos: Array<{ done: boolean, text: string }>
}

// @filename: index.js
// ---cut---
todos.push({
	done: false,
	text: 'eat lunch'
});
```

> [!NOTE] When you update properties of proxies, the original object is _not_ mutated.

### Classes

You can also use `$state` in class fields (whether public or private):

```js
// @errors: 7006 2554
class Todo {
	done = $state(false);
	text = $state();

	constructor(text) {
		this.text = text;
	}

	reset() {
		this.text = '';
		this.done = false;
	}
}
```

> [!NOTE] The compiler transforms `done` and `text` into `get`/`set` methods on the class prototype referencing private fields.

## `$state.raw`

In cases where you don't want objects and arrays to be deeply reactive you can use `$state.raw`.

State declared with `$state.raw` cannot be mutated; it can only be _reassigned_. In other words, rather than assigning to a property of an object, or using an array method like `push`, replace the object or array altogether if you'd like to update it:

```js
let person = $state.raw({
	name: 'Heraclitus',
	age: 49
});

// this will have no effect
person.age += 1;

// this will work, because we're creating a new person
person = {
	name: 'Heraclitus',
	age: 50
};
```

This can improve performance with large arrays and objects that you weren't planning to mutate anyway, since it avoids the cost of making them reactive. Note that raw state can _contain_ reactive state (for example, a raw array of reactive objects).

## `$state.snapshot`

To take a static snapshot of a deeply reactive `$state` proxy, use `$state.snapshot`:

```svelte
<script>
	let counter = $state({ count: 0 });

	function onclick() {
		// Will log `{ count: ... }` rather than `Proxy { ... }`
		console.log($state.snapshot(counter));
	}
</script>
```

This is handy when you want to pass some state to an external library or API that doesn't expect a proxy, such as `structuredClone`.
