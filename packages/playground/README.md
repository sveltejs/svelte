You may use this package to experiment with your changes to Svelte.

To prevent any changes you make in this directory from being accidentally committed, run `git update-index --skip-worktree ./**/*.*` in this directory.

If you would actually like to make some changes to the files here for everyone then run `git update-index --no-skip-worktree ./**/*.*` before committing.

If you're using VS Code, you can use the "Playground: Full" launch configuration to run the playground and attach the debugger to both the compiler and the browser.
