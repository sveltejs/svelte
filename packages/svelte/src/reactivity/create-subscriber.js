/**
 * Returns a `subscribe` function that integrates external event-based systems with Svelte's reactivity.
 * It's particularly useful for integrating with web APIs like `MediaQuery`, `IntersectionObserver`, or `WebSocket`.
 *
 * If `subscribe` is called inside an effect (including indirectly, for example inside a getter),
 * the `start` callback will be called with an `update` function. Whenever `update` is called, the effect re-runs.
 *
 * If `start` returns a cleanup function, it will be called when the effect is destroyed.
 *
 * If `subscribe` is called in multiple effects, `start` will only be called once as long as the effects
 * are active, and the returned teardown function will only be called when all effects are destroyed.
 *
 * It's best understood with an example. Here's an implementation of [`MediaQuery`](https://svelte.dev/docs/svelte/svelte-reactivity#MediaQuery):
 *
 * ```js
 * import { createSubscriber } from 'svelte/reactivity';
 * import { on } from 'svelte/events';
 *
 * export class MediaQuery {
 * 	#query;
 * 	#subscribe;
 *
 * 	constructor(query) {
 * 		this.#query = window.matchMedia(`(${query})`);
 *
 * 		this.#subscribe = createSubscriber((update) => {
 * 			// when the `change` event occurs, re-run any effects that read `this.current`
 * 			const off = on(this.#query, 'change', update);
 *
 * 			// stop listening when all the effects are destroyed
 * 			return () => off();
 * 		});
 * 	}
 *
 * 	get current() {
 * 		// This makes the getter reactive, if read in an effect
 * 		this.#subscribe();
 *
 * 		// Return the current state of the query, whether or not we're in an effect
 * 		return this.#query.matches;
 * 	}
 * }
 * ```
 * @param {(update: () => void) => (() => void) | void} start
 * @since 5.7.0
