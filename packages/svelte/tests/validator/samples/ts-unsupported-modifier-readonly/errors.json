Outside of `<script>` tags, these features are not supported. For use within `<script>` tags, you will need to use a preprocessor to convert it to JavaScript before it gets passed to the Svelte compiler. If you are using `vitePreprocess`, make sure to specifically enable preprocessing script tags (`vitePreprocess({ script: true })`)",
