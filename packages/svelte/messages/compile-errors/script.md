## snippet_invalid_export

> An exported snippet can only reference things declared in a `<script module>`, or other exportable snippets

It's possible to export a snippet from a `<script module>` block, but only if it doesn't reference anything defined inside a non-module-level `<script>`. For example you can't do this...

```svelte
<script module>
	export { greeting };
</script>

<script>
	let message = 'hello';
</script>

{#snippet greeting(name)}
	<p>{message} {name}!</p>
{/snippet}
```

...because `greeting` references `message`, which is defined in the second `<script>`.

## snippet_parameter_assignment

> Cannot reassign or bind to snippet parameter

## state_invalid_export

> Cannot export state from a module if it is reassigned. Either export a function returning the state value or only mutate the state value's properties

## state_invalid_placement

> `%rune%(...)` can only be used as a variable declaration initializer or a class field

## store_invalid_scoped_subscription

> Cannot subscribe to stores that are not declared at the top level of the component

## store_invalid_subscription

> Cannot reference store value inside `<script module>`

## store_invalid_subscription_module

> Cannot reference store value outside a `.svelte` file

Using a `$` prefix to refer to the value of a store is only possible inside `.svelte` files, where Svelte can automatically create subscriptions when a component is mounted and unsubscribe when the component is unmounted. Consider migrating to runes instead.

## typescript_invalid_feature

> TypeScript language features like %feature% are not natively supported, and their use is generally discouraged. Outside of `<script>` tags, these features are not supported. For use within `<script>` tags, you will need to use a preprocessor to convert it to JavaScript before it gets passed to the Svelte compiler. If you are using `vitePreprocess`, make sure to specifically enable preprocessing script tags (`vitePreprocess({ script: true })`)
