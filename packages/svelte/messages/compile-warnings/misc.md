## bidirectional_control_characters

> A bidirectional control character was detected in your code. These characters can be used to alter the visual direction of your code and could have unintended consequences

Bidirectional control characters can alter the direction in which text appears to be in. For example, via control characters, you can make `defabc` look like `abcdef`. As a result, if you were to unknowingly copy and paste some code that has these control characters, they may alter the behavior of your code in ways you did not intend. See [trojansource.codes](https://trojansource.codes/) for more information.
